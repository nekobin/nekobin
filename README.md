# Nekobin

> Elegant pastebin service written in Go

**Nekobin** is an elegant, free and open-source pastebin web application written from the ground up in Go and publicly
hosted at [**nekobin.com**](//nekobin.com). Paste, save and share the link of your text content using a
sleek and intuitive interface!

## Features

- Choose between Dark and Light themes.
- Syntax highlighting for source codes based on file extension.
- Keyboard shortcuts: save <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>, new <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd>, raw <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+R</kbd>.
- Powerful API rate limiter to allow fine-grained control.

## Soon

Nekobin is brand new software and is currently in its [MVP-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).
Although it is already publicly available and is perfectly usable, you can expect new features and information soon!

Current priority: frontend rework using a modern approach and a proper UI framework.

Feedbacks are very welcome, just [open an issue](../../issues/new) and let us discuss.
